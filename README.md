# IoT & Education: A Global City Teams Challenge Project

This is where we store source code and documents that project participants can use.

The GitHub site is broken down into two components:

* [Code Repository](https://github.com/IoTDevLabs/iot-educ) - where source code is kept, such as Python programs and bash scripts
* [Wiki Pages](https://github.com/IoTDevLabs/iot-educ/wiki) - where descriptive information is kept, such as a list of reference books

---

## Code Repository

The code repository is organized as a set of folders:

* **[rpi](https://github.com/IoTDevLabs/iot-educ/tree/master/rpi)** - contains programs and scripts for Raspberry Pi devices
* _folders for other devices and IoT Dev Kits will be added here_

### Downloading a copy of the Code Repository

The entire code repository can be downloaded by clicking on this link:

* https://github.com/IoTDevLabs/iot-educ/archive/master.zip

If you are logged onto a device running Linux, such as a Raspberry Pi or BeagleBone Black, you can use the following command line program to download the respository to your device:

`wget https://github.com/IoTDevLabs/iot-educ/archive/master.zip`

# IoT & Education: A Global City Teams Challenge Project

This is where we store source code and documents that project participants can use.

The GitHub site is broken down into two components:

* [Code repository](https://github.com/IoTDevLabs/iot-educ) - where source code is kept, such as Python programs and bash scripts
* [Wiki pages](https://github.com/IoTDevLabs/iot-educ/wiki) - where descriptive information is kept, such as a list of reference books
